This is a uinput translation program for interpreting key, shuttle, and jog events
from a Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2.  It translates these events into
keystrokes.  It was developed and tested on kubuntu 15.04.

It is a stripped down version of ShuttlePRO designed to run as a daemon and translate
shuttlepro events to basic keystrokes. Will add mousey type translations later

To build/install

# apt-get install build-essential libconfig-dev

$ make
$ make install

This will install:
binary "shuttled" in /usr/local/bin  
sytem service script shuttled.service in /lib/systemd/system
shuttled conf file shuttled.conf in /etc

The udev .rule file will start/stop the daemon on plug/unplug.

If you update the config file, restart the deamon with 
$ sudo service shuttled restart
Or unplug/replug the device.

Configuration instructions:

Config file for assigning keystrokes to the buttons is in 
/etc/shuttled. Currently it uses the uinput key codes (numbers)
A list of common codes are in the config file. You can run

$sudo evtest

Will get you all sorts of usefull information.

If you need configuration on a per user basis or per-window basis,
use the ShuttlePRO application until I finish the userspace applet.

See the shuttled.conf file for information about the file.  You
may also want to look at the comment at the top of readconfig.c.
