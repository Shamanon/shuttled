This is a uinput translation program for interpreting key, shuttle, and jog events
from a Contour Design ShuttlePRO v2.  It translates these events into
keystrokes.  It was developed and tested on kubuntu 15.04.

It is a stripped down version of ShuttlePRO designed to run as a daemon and translate
shuttlepro events to basic keystrokes. I didn't see any use for adding mouse click translations
so I removed them. 

shuttled events can generate sequences of multiple keystrokes,
including the pressing and releasing of modifier keys.  

To install type ./install from this directory.

You can also build manually:

# apt-get install build-essential

$ make

Install instructions:

# cp *.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
# make install

This will install the binary "shuttled" in /usr/local/bin.  
The udev .rules file allows global read access to any
ShuttlePRO v2 devices plugged into the system.  The script passes the
name of the shuttle device to the binary, so you can configure it
there if it is different on your system.

Configuration instructions:

Config file for assigning keystrokes to the buttons is in 
/etc/default/shuttled

If you need configuration on a per user basis or per-window basis,
use the ShuttlePRO application instead.

See the example.shuttlerc file for information about the file.  You
may also want to look at the comment at the top of readconfig.c.
