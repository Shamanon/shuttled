Translate shuttle events and send to uinput as keystrokes.

Indicator applet to be run in userspace to allow per user configurations
and per window configs. See original ShuttlePRO app.

Might want to allow shuttle positions to allow repeated outputs at a
specified time interval. (uinput repeat ??? )

A GUI for setting keystroke bindings would be nice -> part of userspace app?
